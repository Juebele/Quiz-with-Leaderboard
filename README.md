# Quiz-with-Leaderboard

This is the mostly-finished JS quiz.

You need to click the finish button once you've answered all three questions to get a score (100 points for every correct answer).

I wasn't able to make the timer lose time for wrong answers but the console.log does show the time variable is decreased by 10 seconds for every wrong answer.

I have a box where the user can enter and save a name. The finish button should save the name and score to local storage but I'm not sure if it's doing it right.
